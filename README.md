Quote Cookie

The Quote Cookie app is a delightful and straightforward React application that generates random quotes like a fortune cookie. Using the useState hook, it manages the state of the displayed quote. When users click the "Crack the Cookie" button, the app selects a random quote from a predefined array using Math.random(). The chosen quote is then presented on the screen, along with the name of its author, if available. The app's intuitive design and user-friendly interface make it easy for users to quickly receive inspiring and motivational quotes with each click. Enjoy the uplifting experience of Quote Cookie as it brings a touch of wisdom and positivity to your day!
